# AXI Engine
This AXI Engine is made for allowing simple AXI requests in your custom RTL design without the need to design your own or complex AXI IPs.
# Limitations
Constant parameters and reduced states are made for the SEGA architecture. A full and robust version is currently not available, but the design is simple enough for custom changes.
